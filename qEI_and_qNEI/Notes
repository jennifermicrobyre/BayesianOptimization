Step 1:
RWU_initialization_part_1
(a) generate starting conditions given appropriate bounds
(b) save as a csv file

Step 2:
(a) open csv file and adjust the values to round resistance to nearest 50 Ohms
(b) save csv file

Step 3:
RWU_initialization_part_2
(a) open csv file
(b) convert to tensor using pytorch
(c) save tensor as train_x and train_x_all

Step 4:
(a) run experiment, using train_x as inputs, and collect data

Step 5:
RWU_initialization_part3
***remember to change bounds***
(a) create csv file with colony counts
(b) open csv file (train_obj) with colony counts
(c) convert to tensor using pytorch
(d) save tensor as train_obj and train_obj_all
(e) open train_x and train_x_all tensors
(f) generate new conditions to test experimentally
(g) save new conditions, train_x, as csv & tensor
(h) add new conditions to train_x_all and save

Step 6:
(a) run experiment, using train_x as inputs, and collect data

Step 7:
RWU_run_optimization
***remember to change bounds***
(a) create csv file with colony counts
(b) open csv file with colony counts
(c) convert to tensor using pytorch
(d) save tensor as train_obj
(e) update train_obj_all with train_obj
(f) load train_x_all
(g) generate new conditions to test experimentally
(h) save new conditions, train_x, as csv & tensor
(i) add new conditions to train_x_all and save

repeat steps 6 & 7 until done
